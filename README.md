# DSA Big O - Answers

## 1. a. What is the Big O for this?
### Constant time O(1)
- I honestly have no idea how this would apply.

## 1. b. What is the Big O for this?
### Linear time O(n)
- it has to loop the the array and run a comparison against every item.

## 2. Even or odd?
### Constant time O(1)
- Same number/type of operations for any given input.

## 3. Are you here?
### Polynomial time O(n^2)
- 2 levels of looping

## 4. Doubler
### Linear time O(n)
- One loop that performs the same operations for any given input array regardless of size.

## 5. Naive search
### Linear time O(n)
- One loop that performs the same operations for any given input array regardless of size.

## 6. Creating pairs
### Polynomial time O(n^2)
- 2 levels of looping

## 7. Compute the sequence
### Constant time O(n)
- Outputs the Fibonacci sequence to the given place n.

## 8. An efficient search
### Logarithmic time O(log(n))
- The array reference is being divided in half with every iteration.

## 9. Random element
### Constant time O(1)
- Same number/type of operations for any given input.

## 10. What Am I?
### Linear time O(n)
- The amount of iterations is directly proportional to the input n.

## 11. Tower of Hanoi
### Exponential time O(2^n)
- complexity increases exponentially with input size.

## 12. Iterative version
- Solve the drills 1 - 7 from your previous checkpoint (Recursion) iteratively.

## 13. Recursive Big O
- Take your solutions from the recursive exercises that you completed in the previous checkpoint and identify the time complexities (big O) of each of them.

## 14. Iterative Big O
- Take your solutions from the iterative exercises today and identify the time complexities (big O) of each of them.
